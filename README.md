# IUPUI-College-Portfolio
This is a repository of my time at IUPUI in the Purdue School of Engineering Technology as a Computer Engineering Technology Major. It will be divided by class and project. These projects are solely for my portfolio and what I have done whilst at IUPUI.

## Courses List + coding language
- CIT 270 Java
- CIT 214 SQL
- ECET 155 VHDL
- ECET 164 C#
- ECET 309 C
- ECET 334 C/C++
- ECET 434 Python

Each course is focused on the coding language stated beside it. Below is a more detailed description of each course.

## Course Descriptions
- CIT 270 JAVA PROGRAMMING I
  - This course is an introduction to the Java programming language. Students will learn the syntax of the language, how to use objects, classes, and methods, and will perform programming exercises that illustrate how Java is used in stand-alone applications and applets.

- CIT 214 INTRODUCTION TO DATA MANAGEMENT
  - Introduction to basic database development concepts. Extensive exploration of data manipulation using a relational DBMS and SQL. Students develop database applications using the most current database technologies.

- ECET 155 DIGITAL FUNDAMENTALS II
  - A continuation of ECET 109. Sequential logic circuits, flip-flops, counters, programmable device logic, shift registers, logic families, and introductory computer concepts.

- ECET 164 APPLIED OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
  - Problem solving and computing with emphasis on electrical engineering technology applications. Introduction to an object programming language as applied to solving electrical technology problems.

- ECET 309 ADVANCED EMBEDDED MICROCONTROLLERS
  - This course emphasizes advanced applications of embedded microcontrollers, included are microcontroller architecture, use of advanced programmable counter/timer arrays, interrupts, multi-tasking, analog interfaces, hardware abstraction and their peripherals.

- ECET 334
  - This course is to advance the programming skils of the students and learn Android programming in app development and working with a FEZ board and programming in the C base language with microcontrollers. Then putting the two together to program a robot that would be able to be controlled via the Android App
 
- ECET 434 PC SYSTEMS II
  - Real-time PC-based operating systems. Programming Graphical User for control applications using an object-oriented language. Embedded PC hardware, busses, and peripheral programming. Writing device drivers.


These are just basic descriptions of the overall classes and what the learning opportunites are within the courses.
